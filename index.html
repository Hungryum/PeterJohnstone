								<p>Hi I’m Peter, a software engineer but game developer at heart. Proudly from Perth, Western Australia, I have a strong drive to build great software. I have worked on numerous <a href="#projects">projects</a> from mobile games, to interactive webapps and a more recent venture into VR fitness.</p>
								<p>Outside of building great software you will easily find me at my favourite bouldering gym or heading out for a hike on the weekend. Some of my other hobbies include disc golf, kayaking and tinkering with electronics.</p>

							<h2 class="major">Vitruvian VR</h2>
							<div class="media-element">
								<p>Will you survive, or succumb to exhaustion! Feel the weight of your axe as you swing, the impact of each arrow as it collides with your shield. With the help of the Trainer+, we can blend the virtual and physical world.</p>
								<video autoplay muted loop playsinline id="project-video">
								<source src="videos/vr-gameplay.mp4" type="video/mp4">
								</video>
								<br>
								<br>
								<p>Vitruvian VR was a technical demo into VR fitness. With the use of adaptive weights from the Trainer+ I was able to similuate the weight of objects and forces acting upon them. Players had to block incoming arrows with their shield and smash barrels with their axe to survive. I used rumble effects after each hit of an arrow/barrel which would ocillate the force per cable to add to the immersion. The player could also hurl their axe towards the watch tower in an attempt to knock it down after 3 hits. The game would finish once the player had taken enough damage or the watch tower was destroyed. </p>
								<h2>XR:WA</h2>
								<video autoplay muted loop playsinline id="project-video">
								<source src="videos/vitruvian-vr.mp4" type="video/mp4">
								</video>
								<br>
								<br>
								<p>I also had the opportunity to showcase the game at the XR:WA 2022 expo at Hackett Hall, adjacent Boola Bardip museum, with great success. During the busiest parts of the day we had a line of kids and adults waiting to give it a try.</p>
								<p>Players would be tethered to the Vitruvian via wrist straps while holding the Oculus controllers. The game could also be played without the wrist straps if the force was too heavy. From what I found people adapted to the force of the Trainer+ quite quickly and were able to beat the game majority of the time with minimal learning curve.</p>

						<!-- Vitruvian Play -->
						<article class="project" id="vitruvian-play">
							<h2 class="major">Vitruvian Play</h2>
							<div class="media-element">
								<p>Vitruvian Play utilises the technology of the <a href="https://vitruvianform.com/en-au" target="_blank">Trainer+</a> to bring you a workout that's so fun you won't even notice the sweat!</p>
								<p>Soar through the wind on a glider or sail through a canal in your kayak, all from the comfort of your living room. Collect coins and burn calories as you play, then see how you compare on the global leaderboard. Play with your friends online and workout together with passive multiplayer. Make every workout a game with Vitruvian Play.</p>
								<video autoplay muted loop playsinline id="project-video">
								<source src="videos/glider.mp4" type="video/mp4">
								</video>
								<br>
								<br>
								<p>Vitruvian Play was my most ambitious project to date with the goal of solving 'How do we make resistance training fun?'. It was an interesting proposition, and with some already existing solutions I started researching what was out there.</p>
								<p>Ring fit was a game I personally owned and felt was the closest thing to a video game crossed with a fitness coach. Zwift was also another inspiration, with it's massive online playerbase they were dominating the cycling market. Combining the best of both worlds I built Vitruvian Play; an action adventure game with fitness experiences that allowed players to workout together through passive multiplayer.</p>
								<video autoplay muted loop playsinline id="project-video">
									<source src="videos/kayak.mp4" type="video/mp4">
								</video>
								<br>
								<br>
								<p>Now that I had the game planned out, it was time to figure out how players would convert exercise into input. By Bluetooth pairing to the Trainer+ I was able to listen to the Force, Position and Velocity values emited by the frimware. With these values I could track a users movement and apply forces during gameplay. This allowed players to feel like they were actually rowing a kayak or flying a glider by emulating a rumble effect.</p>
								<p>After building an MVP I decided on mobile as platform of choice. Users could cast their phone screen to a TV for a better experience. By building the game for mobile I was able to keep it performative and allow it to be easily accessable to our users. Vitruvian Play would have many games to be developed so to keep the app size small I made each experience downloadable. Players could pick a game to try and it would download within the app. Once downloaded a player could keep playing the experience and would no longer require access to the internet.</p>
								<video autoplay muted loop playsinline id="project-video">
									<source src="videos/neon-hockey.mp4" type="video/mp4">
								</video>
								<br>
								<br>
								<p>Vitruvian Play had 5 experiences to try along with an additional workout mode. Players could see the calories burned in real-time while they played and would get a breakdown of muscle groups used at the end of a session. Daily, Weekly and Monthly leaderboards were also available to give more competative players something to strive for. During a game players could see other users playing within the world through passive multiplayer. This helped the game feel more alive and could be used as motivation or a way to train with your friends.</p>
								<p>My time at Vitruvian gave me room to explore new and interesting ways to build games. I gained valuable knowledge through various limitations from input to graphics and accessibility. I can't wait to bring these new skills to my next project!</p>

								<p>Ready to be oddly satisfied? Stop watching the videos and try it for yourself!</p>
								<p>Soap Carving allows you to carve a variety of virtual soap with real physics. Unlock knives and slice and cut to your hearts content. Experience true ASMR with high quality audio. Play the viral sensation of soap cutting!</p>
								<img src="images/soap-carving-gameplay.jpg" alt="">
								<br>
								<br>
								<p>Soap Carving was a mobile game commissioned by <a href="http://funkt.studio/" target="_blank">Funkt Studio</a> and was built during my spare time. It featured randomly generated soap with a variety of shapes and colours, unlockable knives and a calming asthetic with authentic carving sounds.</p>

								<br>
								<p>Race and fight against other light cycles from the classic arcade game Tron. Encom is a multiplayer snake game that requires each player to trap their opponents in their trail while avoiding theirs. Play against A.I or verse other players on the same keyboard in a multiplayer duel. Use the 'boost' ability to charge ahead of another player and cut them off. Hit a dead end? Simply time up a 'jump' to dodge an enemy's trail.</p>
								<img src="images/encom-gameplay.jpg" alt="">
								<br>
								<br>
								<p>Encom was a remake of an old Tron game I had made in high school with Game Maker. This time I was able to utilise Unity to make the game really shine through the use of bloom and shader effects. Released on <a href="https://hungryum.itch.io/encom" target="_blank">itch.io</a> and <a href="https://gamejolt.com/games/encom-tron/120894" target="_blank">GameJolt</a> for free to good success within the Tron community.</p>

								<source src="videos/basketshot.mp4" type="video/mp4">

								<br>
								<br>
								<p>After Outside the Box I continued honing my skills building mobile apps with the release of BasketShot. A hyper casual game with gameplay and controls that anyone could pick up. It featured a high score mode, where players could see how many shots they could make in a row, and multiple levels to play through with increasing difficulty.</p>
								<img src="images/basketshot-gameplay.jpg" alt="">
								<br>
								<br>
								<p>Each level contained obstacles and challenges such as bouncing the ball of a trampoline or rebounding off a wall before getting it in the hoop. There were four maps to unlock as the player progressed through the game. A store for unlocking and purchasing cosmetics was part of the monetisation strategy.</p>
								<p>You can play BasketShot on Android through the Google Play store, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Hungryum.BasketShot" target="_blank">download here</a></p>

								<img src="images/outside-the-box-poster.jpg" alt="">
								<br>
								<br>
								<p class="title">Outside the box was my first completed project that was published to the Google Play store. Featuring 3D mazes with a variety of shapes and sizes, players would collect coins and compete for best time solved on the global leaderboard. There was also an inifnite maze mode that featured randomly generated mazes with increasing size per level. </p>
								<img src="images/sphere-maze.jpg" alt="">
								<br>
								<br>
								<p>Being my first published game outside of eductaion I learnt a lot about optimisation, building for mobile, and the struggle of marketing a completed product. I went with an advertiser/in-app purchase monetisation stategy with the hopes of pulling in a large player base. Unfortunately exposure for the game was minimal due to a lack of marketing early on in it's lifecycle.</p>

						<!-- Kingdom -->
						<article class="project" id="kingdom">
							<h2 class="major">Kingdom</h2>
							<div class="media-element">
								<p>Kingdom is a strategy medieval battle simulation game with the goal of seizing control of more territory. The game consists of a small battle to breach a castle using your battering ram and catapults. Featuring a lowpoly design and toy like animations, players would strategically place their troops on the battlefield before commencing the onslaught.</p>
								<img src="images/kingdom-siege.webp" alt="">
								<br>
								<br>
								<p>The demo featured 2 levels; an attack stage, breach the castle with your battering ram, and a defend stage, stopping a pair of siege towers. There were 3 units to choose from (Knight/Archer/Horseman) with each one having various strength and weaknesses to a specific unit. Once units were placed on the battlefield and the game begun players would then control a set of catapults/trebuchets to assist in the fight. The game would finish once the stage goal is completed or failed. In the case of the battering ram stage, once the castle is seized or the ram destroyed.</p>
								<img src="images/kingdom-battle.jpg" alt="">
								<br>
								<p>Kingdom was a game built during my time as a student to hone what I had learnt throughout the year. The scope of the project was too large at the time and was built to be more of a proof of concept. It had significant success thanks to the youtube let's play scene with a few prominent youtubers bringing it to light.</p>
